### Introduction

Welcome To Mek's Hub Password Manager - CLI Version. This project was inspired by the mere fact that I consistently have a password manager of some sort (from desktop apps, to websites, and on my phone) always popping up and I figured I'd try and re-create one myself. This application uses [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) as the framework for executing commands and yielding results.
